                    Hey, thanks for stopping by! 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    I'm Zhenda Hu, currently a third year Computer Science student at UCLA (minoring in mathematics). I've always viewed computing as the most powerful creative medium, in that your creations can cause the most impact with the least amount of resources. I started developing and creating applications first in the form of video games as a bored high schooler during the pandemic, and have never looked back since. 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Fast forward to today, my toolbox and maturity as a developer has expanded tenfold. I've had the opportunity to learn a wide variety of programming languages (from object oriented to functional, low level to high level), as well as the privilege to apply the knowledge in a variety of <span className='text-[#64FFDA]'>professional experiences</span> (from application engineering to full stack web development). 
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Here are a few technologies I've been working with recently:
